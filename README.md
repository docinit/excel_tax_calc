# Automated Tiered Tax Calculation in Excel

This document explains an Excel formula designed for the automatic calculation of tiered taxes using dynamic named ranges.

## Solution Overview

The solution uses a single Excel formula that references two key **named ranges**:

* `tax_range`: A named range containing a single column of the **upper bounds** for each tax bracket, sorted in ascending order.
* `tax_rates`: A named range containing a single column of the **tax rates** corresponding to each upper bound in `tax_range`. **Crucially, the rates must be in the same order as the upper bounds in `tax_range`: either within a separate named range or as a parallel column in the same data table.**
* **NOTE**: `D2` is the cell assumed to contain the total income for which the tax needs to be calculated. **Note:** Ensure you adjust this cell reference if your income is located elsewhere.


The formula dynamically determines the applicable tax for each portion of the income based on these defined tiers.

**Benefits of this Approach:**

* **Flexibility:** Easily adaptable to changes in tax brackets and rates by updating the named ranges.
* **Automation:** Automatically calculates the tax based on the income without manual intervention for each tier.
* **Readability (relative to complex nested IFs):** Presents the logic in a more structured manner.
* **Maintainability:** Updating tax information is straightforward through the named ranges.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Set up your tax bracket boundaries in a single column and name it `Tax range`.** Ensure it's sorted in ascending order.
2.  **Create an Excel Table (e.g., named `tbl_income_taxes`) with a column for 'Tax rate'.** Populate this column with the tax rates corresponding to each bracket in `Tax range` column, maintaining the same order.
3.  Create named ranges in Excel:<br>- **tax_range** for `Tax range` column in your table;<br>- **tax_rates** for `Tax rate` column in your table;<br>
4.  **Enter the income in cell `D2` (or adjust the formula accordingly).**
5.  **Enter the provided formula in the cell where you want the total tax to be calculated.**

**Conclusion:**

This formula offers an efficient and dynamic way to calculate tiered taxes in Excel. By leveraging named ranges and the `IFS` function, it provides a more manageable and scalable solution compared to traditional nested `IF` statements.
